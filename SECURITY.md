# Security Policy - Safe LLM Lab

## Overview

Safe LLM Lab is a research platform for systematic LLM safety testing. Given the sensitive nature of research data and API integrations, security is paramount. This document outlines our security measures, policies, and guidelines.

## Security Architecture

### 🔐 Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All localStorage data encrypted using AES-GCM via Web Crypto API
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data never stored in plain text
- **Data Isolation**: Research studies and sessions properly isolated
- **Migration Support**: Automatic migration from unencrypted legacy data

### 🛡️ API Security
- **No Client-Side Keys**: API keys never exposed in client bundles
- **Proxy Architecture**: All LLM API calls routed through secure backend proxy
- **Mock Fallback**: Client-side defaults to mock provider for safety
- **Environment Isolation**: Clear separation between development and production configs

### 🚫 XSS Prevention
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized before processing
- **Safe Rendering**: Eliminated `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers prevent script injection
- **Output Encoding**: All dynamic content properly encoded

### 📝 Secure Logging
- **Data Sanitization**: All logs automatically sanitized to prevent data leakage
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent log format with security event tracking
- **Sensitive Pattern Removal**: API keys, PII, and system paths filtered from logs
- **Log Level Control**: Configurable logging levels for different environments

### 🔒 Session Management
- **Automatic Timeout**: Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Activity Tracking**: User activity extends session lifetime
- **Secure Storage**: Session data stored with integrity checks
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control for different features

### 🌐 Web Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to sensitive browser APIs
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Comprehensive script and resource restrictions

## Security Features

### Input Validation & Sanitization
```typescript
// All user inputs are validated and sanitized
const sanitizedPrompt = InputSanitizer.sanitizePrompt(userInput);
const sanitizedText = InputSanitizer.sanitizeText(userText);
```

### Secure Logging
```typescript
// Security-aware logging prevents data leakage
logSecurity('User action', { sanitizedData });
logError('Operation failed', 'COMPONENT-NAME');
```

### Encrypted Storage
```typescript
// All sensitive data encrypted before storage
const secureStorage = new SecureStorage();
await secureStorage.setItem('key', sensitiveData);
```

### Session Validation
```typescript
// Session integrity and timeout management
const { isAuthenticated, hasPermission } = useSession();
```

## Security Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Never hardcode API keys** in client-side code
2. **Always sanitize user inputs** before processing or storage
3. **Use secure logging** instead of console.log for sensitive operations
4. **Validate session state** before performing privileged operations
5. **Test security measures** regularly during development

### For Researchers

1. **Use strong, unique passwords** for any authentication
2. **Keep research data confidential** and properly classified
3. **Report security concerns** immediately to the development team
4. **Follow data handling policies** for sensitive research content
5. **Log out properly** when finishing research sessions

### For Deployment

1. **Enable all security headers** in production
2. **Configure API proxy** for secure LLM provider access
3. **Set up monitoring** for security events and anomalies
4. **Regular security updates** for all dependencies
5. **Backup and recovery** procedures for encrypted data

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Process
1. **Do not** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** security concerns to the development team
3. **Include** detailed reproduction steps and impact assessment
4. **Wait** for acknowledgment before public disclosure

### Response Timeline
- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **7 days**: Fix development and testing
- **14 days**: Security patch deployment
